# Tasic single-cell RNA-seq configuration for HMOG - lighter regularization test
defaults:
  - hmog_diff
  - _self_

# Model architecture - same as stable baseline
latent_dim: 5        # Tiny latent dimension  
n_clusters: 5        # Stable cluster count

# Training schedule - blend of MNIST efficiency and newsgroups conservatism
lr_scales: [1, 0.3, 0.1]  # Match newsgroups pattern
num_cycles: 5             # Match MNIST efficiency
lgm_noise_scale: 0.01     # Match successful configs
mix_noise_scale: 0.01

# Skip pre-training like successful configs

# Full training - test lighter regularization
full:
  lr: 1e-5           # Keep stable learning rate
  n_epochs: 300      # More than MNIST (100), less than old tasic (1000)
  batch_steps: 1000  # Match MNIST's successful batch size
  grad_clip: 0.1     # Very aggressive gradient clipping
  min_prob: 1e-2     # Higher minimum probabilities
  obs_min_var: 1e-3  # Much higher minimum variance
  lat_min_var: 1e-4  # Much higher minimum variance
  upr_prs_reg: 1e-3  # Reduce regularization 10x
  lwr_prs_reg: 1e-3  # Reduce regularization 10x
  l1_reg: 1e-5       # Very weak L1 to avoid extreme sparsity
  l2_reg: 1e-3       # Reduce L2 regularization 10x
